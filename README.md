# Georgian-Rhyme-Gen
Georgian Rhyme Generator inspired from "ritmiskona.ge"

To run the App simply just "npm install" to install dependencies,
then Run "node index.js" (if you want change the port in the code its right there)


!!disclaimer!!
"ritmiskona.ge" is not my project, its just a site that i was inspired from.
